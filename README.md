## Project Overview

The Employee Management System provides an intuitive interface for HR personnel or admins to efficiently manage employee information. This project utilizes the Spring Boot framework for backend processing, along with Spring Data JPA for data persistence, making CRUD operations straightforward and effective. The frontend is built with responsive design principles, allowing smooth interactions and seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for RESTful services.
- **Spring Data JPA**: ORM for handling database operations.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing employee records.
- **Thymeleaf**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building the user interface.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.

## Architecture and Workflow

The application uses a **multi-layered architecture** that separates concerns effectively, as follows:

1. **Controller Layer**: Manages HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate service methods.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, ensuring the application functions as intended.
3. **Repository Layer**: Handles all data interactions with the MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.
4. **Database Layer**: Stores all employee data and performs CRUD operations.

                      |                           |                           |
                      | <---------------- Message ---------------------------|
                      |                       Response                       |
                      V
                 Database (MySQL)
```

In this structure:
- **Client requests** are processed by **Controller** methods, which forward data to the **Service** layer for business logic handling.
- **Service layer** interacts with the **Repository** for database access.
- **Repository** performs data storage and retrieval, making use of JPA and MySQL.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Easily add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures only valid data is entered and stored.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find specific employees based on different criteria.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on different devices with an intuitive UI.
- **Error Handling**: Manages errors gracefully, providing user-friendly feedback.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK** (version 8 or higher)
- **MySQL** (for the database)
- **Maven** (for building the project)

### Installation
